- **Introduction**
- This analysis considers IPL player performance using ball-by-ball data and salary figures for the latest and three previous IPL seasons. The analysis considers which players performed the best, fits statistical distributions to the data, determines the relationship between performance and salary, simulates what performance (based on the empirical data) may look like in future IPL seasons, and examines player performance consistency using ECDF plots.

- A.	Arrange the IPL data round-wise, batsman, ball, runs, and wickets per player per match;
- B.	Indicate the top three run-getters and top three wicket-takers in each IPL round;
- C.	Fit the most appropriate distribution for runs scored and wickets taken by the top three batsmen and bowlers in the last three IPL tournaments;
- D.	Best Fit distribution for the Player – Rishabh Pant;
- E.	Find the relationship between a player’s performance and the salary he gets in the data (Correlation).
